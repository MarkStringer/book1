#Chapter1

Do you know what?  I can't think of anything to write.  I've spend the whole of the morning "decompressing" from work.  It's too hot outside to move and I'm experimenting with an every-other-day fasting diet, which means all I can eat until 6:30pm is fruit.  

I'm sitting here waiting for my mate Nick and his son to arrive (his wife is going to get here at some point as well) and then we're going to Camden for Japanese food.

Why am I writing here, rather than in my normal text file? Well, I suppose the idea was that I had a business book in me.  I had an idea for a business book a couple of weeks ago - and actually, probably what I *should* be doing is writing that rather than writing this.
